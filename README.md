## **CONCEPT OF PROJECT 01**
=====================

Time to discover the world with a little help from your friends. You will have your own personal travel agent 
by your side accessing her recommendations of the city and country that she has visited previously. 
From accommodation, restaurants, bars & must-see attractions, she has mapped them out and sharing all 
of her tips with you. 



You will be able to access her trusted advice throughout your travel destination on an easy to navigate, 
pinned map. Say good-bye to countless printed word documents, clumsy tourist maps & guide books, 
and bookmarked Yelp reviews from people you don’t even know; this is straight from your friend’s mouth 
to you in an updateable map, which you can comment on as well and share your advice back with her. 



Do you have a work colleague that is going to a travel destination that you know your friend has just visited. 
Well you can ask your friend to share her pinned map with him. This is an easy way to share and update your
favorite travel destinations with friends with a clean, color-coded navigational system listing out all you
need to know about your next travel spot.
